    I previously implemented my personal website using Vue.js, but it quickly
    became hard to maintain without a proper component structure. So I rewrote
    this site with React since I'm more familiar with it now than I am with
    Vue.js.

    Hopefully the ease of modifying content will encourage me to write more
    often.
