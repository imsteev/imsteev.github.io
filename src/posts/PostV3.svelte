    I ported the site implemention from React to Svelte. I realized there was no
    need for a heavy application library like React since this site is more or
    less static. Svelte's role as both a compiler and a framework is pretty
    compelling to me and so I'm looking forward to using this platform as a
    playground for arbitrary content.
